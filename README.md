# [Employee-Directory]()

In this repository, I have built an Employee Directory utilizing a React Front-End. The application can sort by employee name alphabetically and filter your results by name. In creating a React application, it required me to break up the UI into different components and manage component state based off user input.

<h1>Overview:</h1>
When you initialize a React application, all of the Front-End starter code is produced for you. This simplified the overall architecture of the application because I could store all my components in one directory. For testing purposes, the React application updates as you make changes which made styling very easy for the Employee Directory. At a first glance, the application consists of randomly generated employees on one page. The API that I utilized was a [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/documentation).

<h1>User Story:</h1>
<li>As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once</li>
<li>So that I have quick access to their information</li>

<h1>Business Context:</h1>
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

<h1>Technologies Used:</h1>
<li>React Documentation - (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)</li>
<li>Random User Generator API - (https://randomuser.me/documentation)</li>
<li>Bootstrap - (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)</li>

<h1>Setup Before Deployment:</h1>
<li>Clone the repository on your local device and open Terminal or Bash</li>
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to download all application dependencies: "npm install"</li>
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the application: "npm run start"</li>
<li>Once the command is run, a successful message will appear "Compiled successfully! Local: http://localhost:3000"</li>
<li>In your browser, type "http://localhost:3000/"(if tab does not open automatically from running the command line prompt)</li>

<h1>Demo of Application:</h1>

<h1>Future Development:</h1>
If I were to continue developing this application further, I would focus on adding more components for complexity and depth. Within the search navigation component, there could have been a search filter for specific email addresses that contain "Yahoo" for example. For an employee's date of birth, I would have developed that into a different componenet consisting of a year range to filter on.
